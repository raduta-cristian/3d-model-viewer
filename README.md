# 3D Model Viewer -- \[ C++ / OpenGL / Qt \]
### .obj model viewer made with C++ and OpenGL to learn graphics programming basics.

*Open your .obj file and view it in 3D space with 3 different render modes*

**Features:**
- Phong lighting Render mode: simmulate a **realistic** look with ambient, diffuse and specular lighting, using 1 directional light and 4 pointlights
- Lit Render mode: fully lit object, to see every detail
- Wireframe Render mode: only renders lines connecting vertices so you can debug the geometry
- Full 3D Camera motion
- Camera zoom in/out
